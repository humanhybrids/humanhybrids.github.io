			<h2>Tron Classic Arcade Emulator</h2>

			<p>I went to https://archive.org/details/internetarcade and of course had to find a Tron game to play. I found the original
				Tron arcade classic but there were numerous issues that made it very difficult to play on an emulator so I found Discs
				of Tron to play instead. It was easy to play since there were directions given on the page about what keys control the
				game and the directions on the game screen explained the objective of the game. I was a program in the Tron games fighting
				for my life in the disc game. I was standing on a platform (in the game) and threw my identity disc at the opponent trying
				to hit them and knock them down. The discs can bounce off the walls in another way to try to hit you. I managed to beat
				my opponent during the first round which advanced me to a new room with two platforms. Sadly, I haven’t been able to
				win that round yet. I managed to score one of the top ten scores on the board so they let me put my initials in just
				like a real arcade machine.</p>

			<p>I am glad that I have found a way to play a Tron game on my computer but it is definitely more fun to play a Tron game
				on an arcade. There is an arcade on the Santa Cruz boardwalk that had an original Tron arcade. My husband, Cory, and
				I look forward to playing that game every time we go to Santa Cruz. There's something special about playing the game
				the way it is intended. Hardware and software seem to work together seamlessly. Putting in the coin makes it even better
				because that clink sound makes the game come to life. Unfortunately most places, including the Santa Cruz arcade, replaced
				the coins operated system with a digital card reader. But luckily my husband and I were able to play a coin-operated
				Tron game at Flynn's arcade in Disney California as part of the Tron Legacy promotion. Playing the game the way it is
				intended allows the player to better immerse themselves into the game.</p>
