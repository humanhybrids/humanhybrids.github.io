			<p>Welcome to the high seas, Pirates! Do you know what a pirates favorite letter is? A pirates first love be the ‘C’!
				You will be represented by a colored token (yellow, red, green, or blue) and must navigate the seas to gather pirate
				coins and bring them to your treasure chest so other scallywags don’t get your treasure. Don’t be afraid to steal coins
				from other pirates’ bases or to steal coins from other pirates in a duel! You must have five pirate coins in your treasure
				chest (base) before you can be declared the roughest, toughest, no-good pirate that ever was. Argh!</p>

			<p>Objective: Gather pirate coins from the island and steal pirate coins from other pirates in order to collect five pirate
				coins in your treasure chest.</p>

				<li>4 colored tokens (red, yellow, green, and blue)</li>
				<li>2 spinners</li>

			<h3>Argh! Game 1:</h3>

            <p>This is the first paper game I have ever created so the mechanics weren’t quite solid yet. The game began as an I-roll-now-you-roll game. My partner and I had decided to make a game about pirates using pirate coins. The idea was: the first player spins the move spinner. They can move their token in any direction the number of spaces the spinner indicated. Then the next person spins the spinner and moves their token the same way. The object is to grab coins from the middle circle and place them in the colors base. Once a player is in the middle of the coin pile, they spin the coin spinner which determines how many coins the player can take. They place the coins under their token and wait for their next turn so they can move toward their base. While playing, the rules and the board were not complex enough for a fun game. Each turn was just having each person try to grab coins and run to the base then back the same way and again. </p>

            <h3>Game 2.5-3:</h3>

            <img src="images/argh_board.jpg">

            <p>The second game was played at home then small variations were added and played officially during class as the third play through. The differences were large and added some fun to the game. Now there are fewer coins in the pile. Four coins are placed in the pile for each player playing but five coins are needed in your base to win. A player still tries to gain coins and put them in their base but the players can try to steal coins from other players. So now, players must dodge other players while also trying to steal coins from other players. Another row with fewer spaces is added as well so it is easier to follow another player. You can also steal coins from a player’s base but it is hard to do because you must roll as six or a one to take coins out. The numbers on the move spinner have also been changed to help with the flow of playthrough. The turns worked out like this. Player one moves toward the coins as directed by the number they got on the move spinner. They can move in any direction they like. Player two then moves toward the coins as well in the same manner. Player one grabs coins and tries to move them to their base. Player two grabs coins and/or moves toward player one in an attempt to steal their coins. This continues until a player has five coins safely in their base at one time. To steal a coin, the player must catch up to the other player and a duel ensues. They both roll their dice and the higher number rolled wins the coins from the other placer, but only the amount that the coin spinner tells them to take. While playing this, we both rolled a six and weren’t sure what to do so definitely some more rules have to be made.</p>

            <h3>Game 3-4:</h3>

            <img src="images/argh_playing.jpg">

            <p>The current version has some more changes added. The board has some of the same mechanics, but spaces have been changed to make the flow of the game work better. The long spaces between the two circular rows can only be traveled downwards. This makes it so it is easier to steal from an opponent while the player may have coins from the coin pile so they have a chance to lose their coins too. There are fewer spaces between columns also to encourage stealing another player’s coins. Canon cards have also been added to give other players something to do while a different player is on their turn. A canon card may be used at any time which causes another player to lose their coins they are carrying. Each player has two canon cards in their possession when starting the game. If two players duel each other, they roll their dice and the highest two out of three rolls determines who wins the coins.</p>
