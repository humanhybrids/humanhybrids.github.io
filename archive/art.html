			<h3>Bear</h3>
			<p>Digital, 2016.</p>
			<p>I explored shooting a raw photo and manipulating it in post processing as little as possible. To do this,
				I had to hone my techniques with studio lighting. My process in lightroom was simply to switch the photo
				to black and white to take away some of the natural pinks that the lighting was creating around the
				edges of the photo. Nothing else was manipulated or altered in any way.</p>

			<h3>Some Wandered in Desert Wastelands, Finding No Way to a City Where They Could Settle</h3>
			<p>Video, CRT-TV, Raspberry Pi, Electronics, Wood, Plants, 48x16x14 in, December 2019, B4BEL4B, Oakland, CA.
			</p>
			<p>I use a culmination of nostalgic aesthetics mixed with modern technology to explore questions like how
				has our digital realm changed our current realm, have the technological accomplishments of the past
				brought us to a better future, and how can we create a better more technologically infused future that
				progresses our society. I manipulate scenes of a drying lake and vast deserts by distorting form and
				hues with a LZX video synthesizer, then I manipulate the 4k video into a signal that feeds through aged
				electronics to juxtapose past and present technologies.</p>

			<h3>Join the DMA Program at SJSU</h3>
			<p>Digital, March 2018.</p>
			<p>I am told by others that Digital Media Art means that you get to draw on a computer all day. However,
				this is very far from the truth. So, I put together this video to how DMA is a major that teaches skills
				such as code, design, machine interface, fabrication, and video skills. I used an old aesthetic to
				showcase the new technologies that this program has to offer.</p>

			<h3>Yellow Concept</h3>
			<p>Digital, 2017.</p>
			<p> This is my first conceptual art work that I have created (knowingly). I juxtapose the steel, thin object
				with the large, thin, yellow, flowery object to create a dichotomy that explores the inner workings of
				people. The video begins inside the object and slowly rotates around it. The video loops perfectly. This
				was originally shown with the opera, Elijah, performed at the Hammer theater at SJSU in 2017. </p>
