			<p>Never have I ever played a game that didn't explain the world you were entering before throwing you to
				the wolves like Wizards Unite. This game is made by Niantic and has similar aspects as their much easier
				to understand game, Pokemon Go. However, this game doesnâ€™t explain the world to you if you have never
				seen Harry Potter nor does it ease you into the gameplay.</p>

			<p>I am currently at level 6 in Wizard's Unite and I have read all of the on screen tutorials they gave. I
				still don't really understand all the parts of the game. Truth time: I have only seen the first Harry
				Potter movie when it originally came out and I didn't like it so I have never read the books or seen the
				other movies nor do I really even remember the first movie except for Daniel Radcliff's scar makeup and
				bowl haircut. Because of this, I also do not understand the game, Wizards Unite, in its entirety. The
				game has something called "confoundables" that you have to overpower and return to the "Ministry of
				Magic Portkey Office." This is all of course appointed to you by the Statute Secrecy Task Force. There
				are locations in the real world that are used in the game, like Mac Quarrie Hall at SJSU, which are
				shown on the map screen.</p>

			<p>I have a very hard time understanding most of what's happening in the game as I have never been exposed
				to the wizard world before which leaves me thinking about the aesthetics of the game. My emotional
				response is one of boredom and confusion. The game has a fantasy aesthetic, because it is make believe,
				and a submission aesthetic because of its playability as a pastime. I had a hard time understanding the
				dynamics of the game because I had a hard time inferring the rules of the Harold Potter world. The game
				has many mechanics including line drawing, role playing, alliances, and solo game. Unfortunately, it
				does not have a cooperative game mechanic. So, when I was playing the game with my peers during my last
				class, we had to rely on talking to each other offline to cooperate. And one thing students love to do
				is become timid and spend at least 25 minutes sitting in class before suggesting the idea of exploring
				the outside world with the game. By this time, my phone began to die, which was surprising how fast the
				game ate up my charge because I was certain it was at least at 35% before I started playing and by the
				time I went outside it quickly drained to less than 15%. By this time, I only managed to spend another
				10 minutes with my group walking around. Playing the game would be fun with other players if there was a
				way to see them on the map instead of just friending them.</p>
