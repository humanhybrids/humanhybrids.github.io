			<p>Who Carousels is a fun, side-scroller game where the player controls a giraffe who must navigate between
				pinatas on a carousel and spiders because they will totally kill you, bro! Keep track of your score to
				try to beat your friends who play! But be careful because the carousel moves faster and faster as the
				score gets higher!</p>

			<p>As of today, Friday, October 25, 2019, the game is perfect. I thought if I said it online it would be
				true. But the game has some issues that will be revised. Currently, the start screen needs to have
				instructions added to it and the credits also added. On the programming side, I need to add a ceiling so
				the giraffe can avoid the abyss above. Also, I need to make the spiders easier to pass through, possibly
				by extending their height they move. </p>

			<p>The game is almost ready to be published. After these changes are made, the mechanics will be solid.
				Currently, the giraffe hops well, and his rigid body falls nicely. The sounds also work well and are
				intentionally funny (a horse neighing sound that plays every single time the sprite hits a collider. So,
				it plays once to several times each time you die). In the alpha version, there were no spiders, no
				sound, and no start screen. It also stayed at a constant speed. Now the game increases speed as the
				score grows. This game is now addicting to players and visually interesting. Iâ€™m glad that we were able
				to improve upon the game through alpha testing all the way to the finished game. </p>
