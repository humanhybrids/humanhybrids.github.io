            <h2>Artist Statement</h2>

			<p>I use a culmination of nostalgic aesthetics mixed with modern technologies to explore questions about how
				has our digital realm has changed our current realm, have the technological accomplishments of the past
				brought us to a better future, and how can we create a better more technologically infused future that
				progresses our society. I create interdisciplinary art works which explore the duality between time of
				both the past and the present, and our relationships with these technologies. I use digital technologies
				such as video synthesizers, audio synthesizers, videography, and photography along side found objects
				and recycled materials to create my art. </p>
